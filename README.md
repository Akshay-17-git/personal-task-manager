- **Priority Visualization**: Color-coded priority badges for quick identification
- **Due Date Tracking**: Visual indicators for overdue tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved locally using browser's localStorage API
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and keyframe animations for enhanced user experience
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press Enter to quickly add new tasks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and modern web standards
